## Description

CalculateETA has methods to calculate estimated time to finish on loops. It calculates left count of iteration and multiply it with avarage passed time on the loop. On multi-thread applications, it has internal counter that increases everytime methods works via using that calculating left count of loop and multiply it with avarage passed time on the loop.

CalculateETA is optimized for CPU-intense applications.
